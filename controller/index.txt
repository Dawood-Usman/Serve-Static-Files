The controller is the component that enables the interconnection between the views and the model so it acts as an intermediary. The controller doesnâ€™t have to worry about handling data logic, it just tells the model what to do. It process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component and interact with the View to render the final output.
